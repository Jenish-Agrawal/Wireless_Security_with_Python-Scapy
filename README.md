#### Note: All the Python scripts of this repository Requires linux Operating System and Support of Network Interface Card in Monitor Mode.

# 1. Beacon_Frames_Scanner.py 
This Script Scans and provides all the Beacons Frames Discovered by the Network Interface Card. Wireless Beacon Frames are transmitted by the Wireless Access Points. Connection between Access Points and End Devices occur with help of Beacon Frames emitted by WLAN. Beacons Frames carry several information like SSID, MAC-Addresses of Access Point,    . Beacon frames are transmitted periodically to indicate their presence. Whenever we turn on the Wifi Icon in our Mobile Phone we see lots of SSID on the Phone. This is due, Access Points emit the Beacons Frames and our phones discover them to inform the user.

#### Requirements
